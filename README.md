 Final Assignments of the course program IBM Data Science

This repository contains some of the final assignments of the course program IBM Data Science, including its capstone project.

The capstone project consists in finding possible locations for a new Japanese restaurant in Madrid, Spain. The data was extracted using the Foursquare API and good candidate locations were selected based on predefined criteria. The candidates were later grouped using K-means clustering and the centres of the best zones were proposed to stakeholders.

The name of each file contains the name of the course and when needed additional information (eg. report).
