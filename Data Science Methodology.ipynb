The problem is that some diseases have a few symptoms in common, making it hard to make a correct diagnosis/schedulling the adequate medical exams.

    "1. A decision tree classification model will be employed.\n",
    "2. As for the data, a list of the symptoms of only the patients who have been diagnosed and cured in the last five years will be used. This is so, because IBM has been using the same system to register patients' symptoms for the last five years, so all data has the same format, and only the cured patients are considered because then can we be pretty certain that the diagnosis was correct.\n",
    "3. IBM has a system to register patients' symptoms, diagnosis and state of each disease, which they have been using for five years, and the data will be collected from there.\n",
    "4. While investigating the data, it was noticed that some patients from 3 to 5 years ago had a status \"cured\" without a diagnosis being made. The medical staff clarified that they did not found out what was wrong with these patients, but the patients are periodical submitted to routine check-ups and have not shown symptoms. These patients were not considered. As for the data considered, a table was made. Each row represents a patient and each column (except the last) a symptom, while the last column is the diagnosis. Each patient-column cell has a \"0\", if the patient does not have the symptom, or \"1\", if he has, (0 and 1 are floats). The last column has strings in lower case, in order to not repeat a diagnosis with a slightly different name.\n",
    "5. The data is split in a train set (around 70-80%) and a test set. A first decision tree model of some depth is created where the relative cost of \"yes\" or \"1\" is equal to the cost of \"no\" or \"0\" using the train set. Models with different relatives costs and depths are created. The test set is put through each model and the sensitivity, overall accuracy and specificity are calculated for each. To evaluate the models, a compromise between these parameters has to be made, with high sensitivity, meaning a higher true positive rate, and low specificity, meaning a lower false positive rate."
